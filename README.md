## Editing content

Most public copy lives in `src/app/**/page.tsx`. Shared navigation and footer links live in `src/components/Nav.tsx` and `src/components/Footer.tsx`.

Search for `PLACEHOLDER` to find items that should be replaced later:

- Social/profile links
- HT101 cohort details
- Public project links or case studies
- Calendly or Cal.com booking embed
- Images and Open Graph artwork
